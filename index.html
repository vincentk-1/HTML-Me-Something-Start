            <p id="testP"> The elections is around the corner again. To win, a candidate must receive 270 Electoral votes, 
               which is half of the 538 total. These votes equal to the number of the senators and house of
                representatives from all the states. The District of Colombia gets three even though it has 
                no representatives in congress. </p>

               <h4>Unique History of the Presidency.</h4>
               <p>Did you know that at one point in history we have had both the president and the vice president who were not elected to their offices? 
                  In 1973, vice president Spiro Agnew resigned, and President Nixon nominated Gerald Ford as his vice president who was confirmed by 
                  congress and sworn in. <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfxUuGtrs9A" target="_blank">&rAarr; Gerald Ford nomination</a> </p>
               <p>The following year, Nixon resigned the presidency and Ford became the president. 
                  Ford nominated Nelson Rockefeller who was confirmed by both houses of congress again.
